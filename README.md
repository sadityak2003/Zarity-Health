## Assumptions & Additional Features

- A custom drawer for navigation is implemented.
- `Provider` is used for state management.
- Error handling and loading indicators are included.

## State Management Solution

This project uses **Provider** for state management, ensuring efficient UI updates and separation of concerns.

To use Provider, the app is wrapped with `MultiProvider` in `main.dart`:
```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    ProviderScope(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```
